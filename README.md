# Unofficailly more than 600 coding solutions are there, in c, c++, java and bash scripts. 

1. This repo contains the solutions of problems I solved but never submitted on any coding platforms, These problems were solved in offline mode, with pen paper and dry runs Before taking part in actual contests and to learn the abcd of code writing.
2. This set of solutions is mainly of codeforces beginner rating, codechef beginner rating, academic lab exercises and of few books.
3. Main reason behind not submitting them on OJs was the thought of solve it and learn but lateron I realised the credibility of submissions.
